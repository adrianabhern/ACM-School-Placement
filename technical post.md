# Diverse Team Creation

How do you take a large pool of people and create fixed number of teams from them which maximize their racial and gender diversity, equally distributes certain beneficial skills and experiences, and ensure certain rules are followed in the placement like not allowing 17-20 year old's on certain teams?

## Defining the Business Need

Each City Year site faces this challenge every year as we deploy teams of 17-25 year old AmeriCorps members into schools in cities around the United States.  For the vast majority of sites, the solution was essentially to do it by hand. Managers and Directors would just do their best to make sure that they got relatively "equal" teams.

### Problems with Hand Placement

There are a few potential problems in this approach.

#### Cost in terms of worker time

First is the time commitment. The cost to the entire network in terms of the number of worker-hours it takes to complete all placements by hand is in the thousands of worker hours. Here's a breakdown of that estimate: There are probably around 350 program managers in the network. If it takes 4 to 8 hours of full staff to complete placements, then we are looking at between 350*4 (1400) to 350*8 (2800) hours. 

#### Unconscious Bias

Second is the invitation of unconscious bias into the process. By having managers choose their own teammates, we invite like-me biases and other forms of unconscious biases to cause us to deviate from the mean.
